# WebApplicationAPI

This project is an implementation of a .NET Core API using the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern with the MediatR library.

## Overview

The CQRS pattern separates read and update operations for a data store to achieve a higher performance, flexibility, and scalability. In this project, we use the MediatR library to implement CQRS, which simplifies the in-process messaging between objects in the application.

## CQRS

CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It's a pattern that separates reading and writing into different models. By separating the read and write models, we can optimize each model for its specific tasks.

## Pros of CQRS

1. **Performance Optimization**: By separating read and write operations, you can optimize each operation independently. This can lead to significant performance improvements.

2. **Complexity Isolation**: CQRS allows you to isolate the complexity of read and write operations. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Scalability**: With CQRS, you can scale read and write operations independently. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where there are high levels of traffic.

4. **Enhanced Testing**: Since the logic is decoupled, unit testing can be more focused and less complex.

## Cons of CQRS

1. **Increased Complexity**: Implementing CQRS can increase the complexity of your application, as you need to handle two separate models for reading and writing.

2. **Data Consistency**: Since the write model and read model can be updated at different times, there can be a delay in data consistency.

3. **Eventual Consistency**: CQRS often goes hand in hand with Eventual Consistency which might be a new concept for developers used to ACID databases.

## Implementation

We have implemented Commands and Queries using MediatR's IRequest interface. Commands are used for performing actions or changes, while Queries are used for reading data.

Handlers are implemented for each Command and Query, which contain the business logic to handle the Command or Query when it's sent through the MediatR pipeline.
